# Project 4 -- Simple Interpreters and Church Encoding

This project will have you implement two simple interpreters and also
write a Church encoder from a subset of Racket to the lambda calculus.

You should be able to work on the two interpreters as soon as they
come out. They are stored in `p3.rkt`, as they were originally a
continuance of p3 that segues into building the full Church encoder.

You should be able to start your work on the Church encoder after our
lecture on Church encoding. You may refer to Matt Might's blog post on
Church encoding to help you as well:

http://matt.might.net/articles/python-church-y-combinator/

Your Church encoder should be implemented in
`church-encode.rkt`. Please do read the instructions on each of the
functions very carefully: they give hints as to how you should
structure your church coder. Think carefully about how you plan to
implement your Church encoder and feel free to email me with your plan
before doing so.
